For a long time, the creation of computer art was mostly limited to programmers, engineers and scientists, for they had access to computing resources and programming knowledge. Since then, the creation of computer art has become much more accessible with drawing and image editing tools. The recent progress of research in the field of artificial intelligence has led to the development of many image generation tools with different underlying algorithms and purposes. One of these are diffusion models, which are a class of generative models that are able to generate images of high quality conditioned on user input. Services such as 'Stable Diffusion' \autocite{stable-diffusion} and 'Midjourney' \autocite{midjourney} allow users to generate images and art based on image descriptions, also called the prompt, and other parameters, such as for example a reference image.

This new technology has led to a series of controversies, in August 2022 an image generated by Jason Allen won the Colorado State Fair's digital art competition. It was later revealed to be computer generated, which sparked a discussion about the merit of its creator and artificial intelligence in art \autocite{colorado}. Furthermore, these models were trained on a dataset of images collected from the internet. It is currently unclear if the models' creators have committed cases of copyright infringement. In response, lawsuits have been filed \autocite{getty}, and artists started movements against AI art by posting protest pictures \autocite{no-ai-art}.

Nevertheless, these services have become very popular, with many users generating images and sharing them on social media and dedicated discord channels. Many services have dedicated discord servers or websites where the issued prompts and generated images are published. Diffusion model users formed communities on various discords and messageboards like Twitter and Reddit. 


\section{Prompt Design}

The process of building prompts to obtain the desired output is called prompt engineering and has been studied for diffusion models \autocite{investigating} and other generative models like ChatGPT \autocite{chatgpt-prompt-patterns}. This process requires trial and error, since the models are very complex, and it currently cannot be explained how different parts of a prompt influence the output.
Users and researchers discuss the images and the prompts used to generate them; from this exchange and the exploration of these services, the users and researchers \autocite{design-guidelines} noticed patterns in the prompts. For example, the users found that adding specific keywords, such as 'unreal engine' to a prompt, results in a hyperrealistic, 3D rendered image. Furthermore, the usage of artist names can be used to influence the style and content of images \autocite{investigating}.


Many users in the AI art community started mentioning the Polish artist Greg Rutkowski in their prompts. This even led to some of these generated images appearing in front of his work in Google searches. The artist's name was used in some early official tutorials \autocite{dominating} and has become a symbol of AI art. This overall popularity of the artist in the scene might be why his name is mentioned so often in prompts, compared to mentioning him for his unique style. This could also be described as following a trend or cargo cult programming \autocite{ccp}.


In this project, I will investigate how diffusion model users reference artists in their prompts.
I will try to find out if the top-mentioned artists are mentioned to replicate artworks in their characteristic style or if they are instead mentioned for other reasons.
I will investigate this by trying to disprove the following hypothesis:
Top mentioned artists are mentioned specifically to replicate artworks in their characteristic style.


Answering this and other similar questions might become necessary in future discussions about AI art and copyright infringement concerning artists' work. Furthermore, it might help to understand the diffusion model users and their motivations, which could help build more accurate generative models.

%Willison et al. (2022) analogize writing prompts to wizards learning “magical spells”: users do not understand why some prompts work, but they will add these prompts to their “spell book.” For example, to generate highly-detailed images, it has become a common practice to add special keywords such as “trending on artstation” and “unreal engine” in the prompt.

%Each project needs a research question that can be investigated by means of some data and an analytical method. The research question is typically motivated by some related work (quote at least 4-5 relevant papers). Also show what others have done in this research area and show why your research question is relevant. Possibly also highlight the research gap (what’s new?) that you plan to fill.

Results


TODO:

By using your method on your data, you will produce some
results (numbers, plots, etc.). Please note that any scripts
you will generate during the project should also be briefly
mentioned in the documentation. However, please do not
put source code in the documentation. Rather share with
us any scripts (and datasets) you create by means of a
repository.

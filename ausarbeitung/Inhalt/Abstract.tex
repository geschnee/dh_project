In this work, I investigate the prompting behaviour of 'Stable Diffusion' users in regard to the inclusion of artist names in prompts. I try to disprove the hypothesis that top-mentioned artists are mentioned for their style. I find that there is a correlation between the popularity of an artist and the style references. The prompts of more popular artists resemble the prompts in which they are not mentioned more closely than those of less popular artists.

The conclusion is that more popular artists are less used for their characteristic style but rather are included in prompts for other reasons.

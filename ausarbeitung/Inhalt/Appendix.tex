\begin{table}[h]
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{||c c p{0.6\linewidth}||} 
         \hline
         Column Name & Type & Description \\ [0.5ex] 
         \hline\hline
         image\_name & string & Image UUID filename. \\ 
         \hline
         prompt & string & The text prompt used to generate this image. \\ 
         \hline
         part\_id & uint16 &	Folder ID of this image. \\ 
         \hline
         seed & uint32 & Random seed used to generate this image. \\ 
         \hline
         step & uint16 & Step count (hyperparameter). \\ 
         \hline
         cfg & float32 & Guidance scale (hyperparameter). \\ 
         \hline
         sampler & uint8 & Sampler method (hyperparameter). Mapping: 1: 'ddim', 2: 'plms', 3: 'k\_euler', 4: 'k\_euler\_ancestral', 5: 'k\_heun', 6: 'k\_dpm\_2', 7: 'k\_dpm\_2\_ancestral', 8: 'k\_lms', 9: 'others'. \\ 
         \hline
         width & uint16 & Image width. \\ 
         \hline
         height	& uint16 & Image height. \\ 
         \hline
         user\_name & string & The unique discord ID's SHA256 hash of the user who generated this image. For example, the hash for xiaohk\#3146 is e285b7ef63be99e9107cecd79b280bde 602f17e0ca8363cb7a0889b67f0b5ed0. 'deleted\_account' refer to users who have deleted their accounts. None means the image has been deleted before we scrape it for the second time. \\ 
         \hline
         timestamp & timestamp & UTC Timestamp when this image was generated. None means the image has been deleted before we scrape it for the second time. Note that timestamp is not accurate for duplicate images that have the same prompt, hypareparameters, width, height. \\ 
         \hline
         image\_nsfw & float32 & Likelihood of an image being NSFW. Scores are predicted by LAION's state-of-art NSFW detector (range from 0 to 1). A score of 2.0 means the image has already been flagged as NSFW and blurred by Stable Diffusion. \\ 
         \hline
         prompt\_nsfw & float32 & Likelihood of a prompt being NSFW. Scores are predicted by the library Detoxicy. Each score represents the maximum of toxicity and sexual\_explicit (range from 0 to 1). \\ [1ex]

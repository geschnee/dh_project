\addchap{Separation of Duties}


Moritz Weinrich and I worked together on this topic until beginning of March 2023. Up to that point we shared our work and met up to discuss the progress.
During the initial discussion with Dr. Andreas Niekler and Dr. Thomas Efer we found the dataset \autocite{poloclub-diffusiondb} and decided to use that for our project.
Subsequently, Moritz researched mappings of artists to art-styles. Moritz found the two datasets \autocite{thelist} and \autocite{wikipedia-styles}.
During that time, I mainly analysed the \autocite{poloclub-diffusiondb} dataset and the distibutions of artists present in the dataset.

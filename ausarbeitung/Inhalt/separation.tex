Moritz Weinrich and I worked together on this topic until beginning of March 2023. Up to that point we shared our work and met up to discuss the progress.
During the initial discussion with Dr. Andreas Niekler and Dr. Thomas Efer we found the dataset \autocite{poloclub-diffusiondb} and decided to use that for our project.
Subsequently Moritz researched mappings of artists to art-styles and applied the mapping to the found artists. 
During that time I analysed the \autocite{poloclub-diffusiondb} dataset and the distibutions of artists present in the dataset.
